# SVL_BeamAnalysis
Written for Smart Vision Lights, This program uses the Allied Vision Technologies Vimba SDK to capture cross sections of light beams and perform different analysis on the images.

for example, AVT_BeamAnalysis.py is a script that captures a cross section of a beam at Xmm away, and finds 80% unifmormity in the beam, takes a horizontal and vertical profile of the 80% unifmormity, and plots the curves to find irregular patterns. This data is then compared to a threshold for Pass/Fail verification.
